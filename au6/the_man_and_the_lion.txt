a man and a lion traveled together through the forest
they soon began to boast of their respective superiority to each other in strength and prowess
as they were disputing they passed a statue carved in stone which represented
a lion strangled by a man
the traveler pointed to it and said
see there
how strong we are and how we prevail over even the king of beasts
the lion replied
this statue was made by one of you men
if we lions knew how to erect statues you would see the man placed under the paw of the lion
