a middle-aged man whose hair had begun to turn gray courted two women at the same time
one of them was young and the other well advanced in years
the elder woman ashamed to be courted by a man younger than herself made a point whenever her admirer visited her to pull out some portion of his black hairs
the younger on the contrary not wishing to become the wife of an old man was equally zealous in removing every gray hair she could find
thus it came to pass that between them both he very soon found that he had not a hair left on his head
