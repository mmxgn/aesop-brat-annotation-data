a labourer lay listening to a nightingale 's song throughout the summer night
so pleased was he with it that the next night he set a trap for it and captured it
now that i have caught thee
he cried
thou shalt always sing to me
we nightingales never sing in a cage
said the bird
then i 'll eat thee
said the labourer
i have always heard say that a nightingale on toast is dainty morsel
nay kill me not
said the nightingale
but let me free and i 'll tell thee three things far better worth than my poor body
the labourer let him loose and he flew up to a branch of a tree and said
never believe a captive 's promise
that 's one thing
then again keep what you have
and third piece of advice is sorrow not over what is lost forever
then the song-bird flew away
