a lion fatigued by the heat of a summer 's day fell fast asleep in his den
a mouse ran over his mane and ears and woke him from his slumbers
he rose up and shook himself in great wrath and searched every corner of his den to find the mouse
a fox seeing him said
a fine lion you are to be frightened of a mouse
't is not the mouse i fear
said the lion
i resent his familiarity and ill-breeding
