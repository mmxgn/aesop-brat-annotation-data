in the old days when men were allowed to have many wives a middle-aged man had one wife that was old and one that was young
each loved him very much and desired to see him like herself
now the man 's hair was turning grey which the young wife did not like as it made him look too old for her husband
so every night she used to comb his hair and pick out the white ones
but the elder wife saw her husband growing grey with great pleasure for she did not like to be mistaken for his mother
so every morning she used to arrange his hair and pick out as many of the black ones as she could
the consequence was the man soon found himself entirely bald
