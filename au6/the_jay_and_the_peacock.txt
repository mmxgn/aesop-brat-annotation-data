a jay venturing into a yard where peacocks used to walk found there a number of feathers which had fallen from the peacocks when they were moulting
he tied them all to his tail and strutted down towards the peacocks
when he came near them they soon discovered the cheat and striding up to him pecked at him and plucked away his borrowed plumes
so the jay could do no better than go back to the other jays who had watched his behaviour from a distance
