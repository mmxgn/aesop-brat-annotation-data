the lion wearied jupiter with his frequent complaints
it is true o jupiter
he said
that i am gigantic in strength handsome in shape and powerful in attack
i have jaws well provided with teeth and feet furnished with claws and i lord it over all the beasts of the forest and what a disgrace it is that being such as i am i should be frightened by the crowing of a cock
jupiter replied
why do you blame me without a cause
i have given you all the attributes which i possess myself and your courage never fails you except in this one instance
on hearing this the lion groaned and lamented very much and reproaching himself with his cowardice wished that he might die
as these thoughts passed through his mind he met an elephant and came close to hold a conversation with him
after a time he observed that the elephant shook his ears very often and he inquired what was the matter and why his ears moved with such a tremor every now and then
just at that moment a gnat settled on the head of the elephant and he replied
do you see that little buzzing insect
if it enters my ear my fate is sealed
i should die presently
the lion said
well since so huge a beast is afraid of a tiny gnat i will no more complain nor wish myself dead
i find myself even as i am better off than the elephant
