a lion and a bear seized a kid at the same moment and fought fiercely for its possession
when they had fearfully lacerated each other and were faint from the long combat they lay down exhausted with fatigue
a fox who had gone round them at a distance several times saw them both stretched on the ground with the kid lying untouched in the middle
he ran in between them and seizing the kid scampered off as fast as he could
the lion and the bear saw him but not being able to get up said
woe be to us that we should have fought and belabored ourselves only to serve the turn of a fox
it sometimes happens that one man has all the toil and another all the profit
