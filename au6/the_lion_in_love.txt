a lion once fell in love with a beautiful maiden and proposed marriage to her parents
the old people did not know what to say
they did not like to give their daughter to the lion yet they did not wish to enrage the king of beasts
at last the father said
we feel highly honoured by your majesty 's proposal but you see our daughter is a tender young thing and we fear that in the vehemence of your affection you might possibly do her some injury
might i venture to suggest that your majesty should have your claws removed and your teeth extracted then we would gladly consider your proposal again
the lion was so much in love that he had his claws trimmed and his big teeth taken out
but when he came again to the parents of the young girl they simply laughed in his face and bade him do his worst
