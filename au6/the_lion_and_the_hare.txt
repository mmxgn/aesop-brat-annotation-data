a lion came across a hare who was fast asleep
he was just in the act of seizing her when a fine young hart trotted by and he left the hare to follow him
the hare scared by the noise awoke and scudded away
the lion was unable after a long chase to catch the hart and returned to feed upon the hare
on finding that the hare also had run off he said
i am rightly served for having let go of the food that i had in my hand for the chance of obtaining more
