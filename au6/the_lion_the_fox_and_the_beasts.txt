the lion once gave out that he was sick unto death and summoned the animals to come and hear his last will and testament
so the goat came to the lion 's cave and stopped there listening for a long time
then a sheep went in and before she came out a calf came up to receive the last wishes of the lord of the beasts
but soon the lion seemed to recover and came to the mouth of his cave and saw the fox who had been waiting outside for some time
why do you not come to pay your respects to me
said the lion to the fox
i beg your majesty 's pardon
said the fox
but i noticed the track of the animals that have already come to you
and while i see many hoof-marks going in i see none coming out
till the animals that have entered your cave come out again i prefer to remain in the open air
