some said this and some said that
but at last a young mouse got up and said he had a proposal to make which he thought would meet the case
you will all agree
said he
that our chief danger consists in the sly and treacherous manner in which the enemy approaches us
now if we could receive some signal of her approach we could easily escape from her
i venture therefore to propose that a small bell be procured and attached by a ribbon round the neck of the cat
by this means we should always know when she was about and could easily retire while she was in the neighbourhood
this proposal met with general applause until an old mouse got up and said
that is all very well but who is to bell the cat
the mice looked at one another and nobody spoke

text = r"""a slave named androcles once escaped from his master and fled to the forest
as he was wandering about there he came upon a lion lying down moaning and groaning
at first he turned to flee but finding that the lion did not pursue him he turned back and went up to him
as he came near the lion put out his paw which was all swollen and bleeding and androcles found that a huge thorn had got into it and was causing all the pain
he pulled out the thorn and bound up the paw of the lion who was soon able to rise and lick the hand of androcles like a dog
then the lion took androcles to his cave and every day used to bring him meat from which to live
but shortly afterwards both androcles and the lion were captured and the slave was sentenced to be thrown to the lion after the latter had been kept without food for several days
the emperor and all his court came to see the spectacle and androcles was led out into the middle of the arena
soon the lion was let loose from his den and rushed bounding and roaring towards his victim
but as soon as he came near to androcles he recognised his friend and fawned upon him and licked his hands like a friendly dog
the emperor surprised at this summoned androcles to him who told him the whole story
whereupon the slave was pardoned and freed and the lion let loose to his native forest"""
