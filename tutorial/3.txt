Thank you for following the tutorial. Some final words:

1. Changes are automatically saved, no need for you to do anything.

2. Some things might be annotated already, you can skip them, or you can correct them if you think they are wrong.

3. Every annotation supports Notes (double click them), which is a handy way to add "comments" for other annotators to see.

4. Make sure you have "autorefresh" on. Go to the top of the window -> Options, and select Autorefresh under "Network options". This lets you see the changes by other people at real time.

Next step is to go to the top of the window, choose Collections and choose from your user's directory to annotate. There are 36 short fables in each directory.
