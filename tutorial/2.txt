In this part we learn how to annotate character lines and anaphora.

This is actually quite simple. You annotate the relevant text as a Character_Line, then annotate the verb that shows that someone says something as "Says",

Finally you drag from the "Says" entity to the Character and the Character line.

Try it now:


The boy said: "I do not know, Sir!"


The boy said: "I do not know, Sir!"


There are cases that instead of the character's or object's or even place's name, we have anaphora such as "he", "it", or "there". 

To annotate as such, annotate the anaphora text as either character, object, or place (depending what the original entity it refers to is).

Then click and drag from it to the entity it refers to.
