Let's revisit our first example:


A bull was feeding in a meadow.


We expect feeding to produce some kind of sound. To annotate that, we select "feeding", and then "Sound_Effect".

Then we click and drag the mouse from the annotation of "feeding" to the annotation of "bull". We

do the same from "feeding" to "meadow". Try that below:


A bull was feeding in a meadow.


Note that there might be multiple agents (objects or characters) contributing to a sound.


There was a boy named Ann, and a boy named Bill. They were playing on the road with their ball.


There was a boy named Ann, and a boy named Bill. They were playing on the road with their ball.


In case there is a description of a sound that modifies or adds to the perceived sound, annotate it as "Sound_Effect"

as well and then link the two "Sound_Effect" entities together.


The cellar-door flew open with a booming sound.
