Welcome to the "Aesop's fable audible annotation project".

You will be asked to annotate some text, please take a little while

to read this tutorial. You can go forward or backward using the blue arrows

at the top of the page. Note that you need to be logged in. If you are not, please do so now.


The goal is to annotate text that points to events that produce sounds, and the agents

that contribute to these events.


Let's start with a simple example:


A bull was feeding in a meadow.


Here we have a Character: "bull", and a Place: "meadow". To annotate them

as such, select the text "bull" below and select Character from the pop up window. 

Do the same for "meadow" and Place. Try that to the text below:


A bull was feeding in a meadow.


Characters can also have age and gender. To annotate as such, annotate the character, and choose

the correct attributes from the pop up window:


Oliver Twist was a young boy.


Oliver Twist was a young boy.


Note: If you do a mistake, you can double click an annotation, choose "delete" and

redo it. You can also annotate Objects as such:


In the old cellar, there was a rusty door.


In the old cellar, there was a rusty door.


Please press "next" from the arrows at the top to proceed to the next part.
