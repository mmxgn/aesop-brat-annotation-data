an ass and a cock were in a straw-yard together when a lion desperate from hunger approached the spot
he was about to spring upon the ass when the cock ( to the sound of whose voice the lion it is said has a singular aversion ) crowed loudly and the lion fled away as fast as he could
the ass observing his trepidation at the mere crowing of a cock summoned courage to attack him and galloped after him for that purpose
he had run no long distance when the lion turning about seized him and tore him to pieces
false confidence often leads into danger
