hercules once journeying along a narrow roadway came across a strange-looking animal that reared its head and threatened him
nothing daunted the hero gave him a few lusty blows with his club and thought to have gone on his way
the monster however much to the astonishment of hercules was now three times as big as it was before and of a still more threatening aspect
he thereupon redoubled his blows and laid about him fast and furiously
but the harder and quicker the strokes of the club the bigger and more frightful grew the monster and now completely filled up the road
pallas then appeared upon the scene
stop hercules
said she
cease your blows
the monster 's name is strife
let it alone and it will soon become as little as it was at first
