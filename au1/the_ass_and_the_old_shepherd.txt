a shepherd watching his ass feeding in a meadow was alarmed all of a sudden by the cries of the enemy
he appealed to the ass to fly with him lest they should both be captured but the animal lazily replied
why should i pray
do you think it likely the conqueror will place on me two sets of panniers
'
no
rejoined the shepherd
then
said the ass
as long as i carry the panniers what matters it to me whom i serve
' in a change of government the poor change nothing beyond the name of their master
