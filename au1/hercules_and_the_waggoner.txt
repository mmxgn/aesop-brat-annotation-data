a waggoner was once driving a heavy load along a very muddy way
at last he came to a part of the road where the wheels sank half-way into the mire and the more the horses pulled the deeper sank the wheels
so the waggoner threw down his whip and knelt down and prayed to hercules the strong
o hercules help me in this my hour of distress
quoth he
but hercules appeared to him and said
tut man do n't sprawl there
get up and put your shoulder to the wheel
