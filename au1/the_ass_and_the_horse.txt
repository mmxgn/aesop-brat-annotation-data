an ass besought a horse to spare him a small portion of his feed
yes
said the horse
if any remains out of what i am now eating i will give it you for the sake of my own superior dignity and if you will come when i reach my own stall in the evening i will give you a little sack full of barley
the ass replied
thank you
but i ca n't think that you who refuse me a little matter now
will by and by confer on me a greater benefit
