in a field one summer 's day a grasshopper was hopping about chirping and singing to its heart 's content
an ant passed by bearing along with great toil an ear of corn he was taking to the nest
why not come and chat with me
said the grasshopper
instead of toiling and moiling in that way
i am helping to lay up food for the winter
said the ant
and recommend you to do the same
why bother about winter
said the grasshopper
we have got plenty of food at present
but the ant went on its way and continued its toil
when the winter came the grasshopper had no food and found itself dying of hunger while it saw the ants distributing every day corn and grain from the stores they had collected in the summer
