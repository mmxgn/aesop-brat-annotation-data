there was once a bald man who sat down after work on a hot summer 's day
a fly came up and kept buzzing about his bald pate and stinging him from time to time
the man aimed a blow at his little enemy but acks palm came on his head instead
again the fly tormented him but this time the man was wiser and said
you will only injure yourself if you take notice of despicable enemies
