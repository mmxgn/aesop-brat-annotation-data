an ass carrying a load of wood passed through a pond
as he was crossing through the water he lost his footing stumbled and fell and not being able to rise on account of his load groaned heavily
some frogs frequenting the pool heard his lamentation and said
what would you do if you had to live here always as we do when you make such a fuss about a mere fall into the water
men often bear little grievances with less courage than they do large misfortunes
