two neighbours came before jupiter and prayed him to grant their hearts ' desire
now the one was full of avarice and the other eaten up with envy
so to punish them both jupiter granted that each might have whatever he wished for himself but only on condition that his neighbour had twice as much
the avaricious man prayed to have a room full of gold
no sooner said than done
but all his joy was turned to grief when he found that his neighbour had two rooms full of the precious metal
then came the turn of the envious man who could not bear to think that his neighbour had any joy at all
so he prayed that he might have one of his own eyes put out by which means his companion would become totally blind
