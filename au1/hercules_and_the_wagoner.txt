a carter was driving a wagon along a country lane when the wheels sank down deep into a rut
the rustic driver stupefied and aghast stood looking at the wagon and did nothing but utter loud cries to hercules to come and help him
hercules it is said appeared and thus addressed him
put your shoulders to the wheels my man
goad on your bullocks and never more pray to me for help until you have done your best to help yourself or depend upon it you will henceforth pray in vain
self-help is the best help
