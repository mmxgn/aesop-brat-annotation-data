mercury once determined to learn in what esteem he was held among mortals
for this purpose he assumed the character of a man and visited in this disguise a sculptor 's studio having looked at various statues he demanded the price of two figures of jupiter and juno
when the sum at which they were valued was named he pointed to a figure of himself saying to the sculptor
you will certainly want much more for this as it is the statue of the messenger of the gods and author of all your gain
the sculptor replied
well if you will buy these i 'll fling you that into the bargain
