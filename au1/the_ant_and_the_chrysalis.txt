an ant nimbly running about in the sunshine in search of food came across a chrysalis that was very near its time of change
the chrysalis moved its tail and thus attracted the attention of the ant who then saw for the first time that it was alive
poor pitiable animal
cried the ant disdainfully
what a sad fate is yours
while i can run hither and thither at my pleasure and if i wish ascend the tallest tree you lie imprisoned here in your shell with power only to move a joint or two of your scaly tail
the chrysalis heard all this but did not try to make any reply
a few days after when the ant passed that way again nothing but the shell remained
wondering what had become of its contents he felt himself suddenly shaded and fanned by the gorgeous wings of a beautiful butterfly
behold in me
said the butterfly
your much-pitied friend
boast now of your powers to run and climb as long as you can get me to listen
so saying the butterfly rose in the air and borne along and aloft on the summer breeze was soon lost to the sight of the ant forever
