an ass once carried through the streets of a city a famous wooden image to be placed in one of its temples
as he passed along the crowd made lowly prostration before the image
the ass thinking that they bowed their heads in token of respect for himself bristled up with pride gave himself airs and refused to move another step
the driver seeing him thus stop laid his whip lustily about his shoulders and said
o you perverse dull-head
it is not yet come to this that men pay worship to an ass
others
