a trumpeter during a battle ventured too near the enemy and was captured by them
they were about to proceed to put him to death when he begged them to hear his plea for mercy
i do not fight
said he
and indeed carry no weapon
i only blow this trumpet and surely that can not harm you
then why should you kill me
you may not fight yourself
said the others
but you encourage and guide your men to the fight
