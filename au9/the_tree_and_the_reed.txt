well little one
said a tree to a reed that was growing at its foot
why do you not plant your feet deeply in the ground and raise your head boldly in the air as i do
i am contented with my lot
said the reed
i may not be so grand but i think i am safer
safe
sneered the tree
who shall pluck me up by the roots or bow my head to the ground
but it soon had to repent of its boasting for a hurricane arose which tore it up from its roots and cast it a useless log on the ground while the little reed bending to the force of the wind soon stood upright again when the storm had passed over
