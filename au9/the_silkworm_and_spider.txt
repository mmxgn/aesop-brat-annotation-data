having received an order for twenty yards of silk from princess lioness the silkworm sat down at her loom and worked away with zeal
a spider soon came around and asked to hire a web-room near by
the silkworm acceded and the spider commenced her task and worked so rapidly that in a short time the web was finished
just look at it
she said
and see how grand and delicate it is
you can not but acknowledge that i 'm a much better worker than you
see how quickly i perform my labors
yes
answered the silkworm
but hush up for you bother me
your labors are designed only as base traps and are destroyed whenever they are seen and brushed away as useless dirt
while mine are stored away as ornaments of royalty
