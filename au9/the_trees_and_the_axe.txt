a man came into a forest and asked the trees to provide him a handle for his axe
the trees consented to his request and gave him a young ash-tree
no sooner had the man fitted a new handle to his axe from it than he began to use it and quickly felled with his strokes the noblest giants of the forest
an old oak lamenting when too late the destruction of his companions said to a neighboring cedar
the first step has lost us all
if we had not given up the rights of the ash we might yet have retained our own privileges and have stood for ages
