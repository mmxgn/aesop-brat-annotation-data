the sick kite a kite sick unto death said to his mother
o mother
do not mourn but at once invoke the gods that my life may be prolonged
she replied
alas
my son which of the gods do you think will pity you
is there one whom you have not outraged by filching from their very altars a part of the sacrifice offered up to them
' we must make friends in prosperity if we would have their help in adversity
