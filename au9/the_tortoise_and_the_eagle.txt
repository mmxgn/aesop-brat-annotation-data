a tortoise lazily basking in the sun complained to the sea-birds of her hard fate that no one would teach her to fly
an eagle hovering near heard her lamentation and demanded what reward she would give him if he would take her aloft and float her in the air
i will give you
she said
all the riches of the red sea
i will teach you to fly then
said the eagle
and taking her up in his talons he carried her almost to the clouds suddenly he let her go and she fell on a lofty mountain dashing her shell to pieces
the tortoise exclaimed in the moment of death
i have deserved my present fate
for what had i to do with wings and clouds who can with difficulty move about on the earth
' if men had all they wished they would be often ruined
