the two dogs a man had two dogs a hound trained to assist him in his sports and a housedog taught to watch the house
when he returned home after a good day 's sport he always gave the housedog a large share of his spoil
the hound feeling much aggrieved at this reproached his companion saying
it is very hard to have all this labor while you who do not assist in the chase luxuriate on the fruits of my exertions
the housedog replied
do not blame me my friend but find fault with the master who has not taught me to labor but to depend for subsistence on the labor of others
