a stag overpowered by heat came to a spring to drink
seeing his own shadow reflected in the water he greatly admired the size and variety of his horns but felt angry with himself for having such slender and weak feet
while he was thus contemplating himself a lion appeared at the pool and crouched to spring upon him
the stag immediately took to flight and exerting his utmost speed as long as the plain was smooth and open kept himself easily at a safe distance from the lion
but entering a wood he became entangled by his horns and the lion quickly came up to him and caught him
when too late he thus reproached himself
woe is me
how i have deceived myself
these feet which would have saved me i despised and i gloried in these antlers which have proved my destruction
