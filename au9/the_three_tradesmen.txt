a great city was besieged and its inhabitants were called together to consider the best means of protecting it from the enemy
a bricklayer earnestly recommended bricks as affording the best material for an effective resistance
a carpenter with equal enthusiasm proposed timber as a preferable method of defense
upon which a currier stood up and said

and nothing so good as leather
