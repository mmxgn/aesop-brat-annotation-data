a very hungry fox seeing some bread and meat left by shepherds in the hollow of an oak crept into the hole and made a hearty meal
when he finished he was so full that he was not able to get out and began to groan and lament his fate
another fox passing by heard his cries and coming up inquired the cause of his complaining
on learning what had happened he said to him
ah you will have to remain there my friend until you become such as you were when you crept in and then you will easily get out
