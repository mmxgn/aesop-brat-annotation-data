a shipwrecked man having been cast upon a certain shore slept after his buffetings with the deep
after a while he awoke and looking upon the sea loaded it with reproaches
he argued that it enticed men with the calmness of its looks but when it had induced them to plow its waters it grew rough and destroyed them
the sea assuming the form of a woman replied to him
blame not me my good sir but the winds for i am by my own nature as calm and firm even as this earth
but the winds suddenly falling on me create these waves and lash me into fury
