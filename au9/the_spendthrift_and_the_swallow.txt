a young man a great spendthrift had run through all his patrimony and had but one good cloak left
one day he happened to see a swallow which had appeared before its season skimming along a pool and twittering gaily
he supposed that summer had come and went and sold his cloak
not many days later winter set in again with renewed frost and cold
when he found the unfortunate swallow lifeless on the ground he said
unhappy bird
what have you done
by thus appearing before the springtime you have not only killed yourself but you have wrought my destruction also
