now you must know that a town mouse once upon a time went on a visit to his cousin in the country
he was rough and ready this cousin but he loved his town friend and made him heartily welcome
beans and bacon cheese and bread were all he had to offer but he offered them freely
the town mouse rather turned up his long nose at this country fare and said
i can not understand cousin how you can put up with such poor food as this but of course you can not expect anything better in the country
come you with me and i will show you how to live
when you have been in town a week you will wonder how you could ever have stood a country life
no sooner said than done the two mice set off for the town and arrived at the town mouse 's residence late at night
you will want some refreshment after our long journey
said the polite town mouse and took his friend into the grand dining-room
there they found the remains of a fine feast and soon the two mice were eating up jellies and cakes and all that was nice
suddenly they heard growling and barking
what is that
said the country mouse
it is only the dogs of the house
answered the other
only
said the country mouse
i do not like that music at my dinner
just at that moment the door flew open in came two huge mastiffs and the two mice had to scamper down and run off
good-bye cousin
said the country mouse
what
going so soon
said the other
yes
he replied
better beans and bacon in peace than cakes and ale in fear
