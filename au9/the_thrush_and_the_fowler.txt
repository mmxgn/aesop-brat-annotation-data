a thrush was feeding on a myrtle-tree and did not move from it because its berries were so delicious
a fowler observed her staying so long in one spot and having well bird-limed his reeds caught her
the thrush being at the point of death exclaimed
o foolish creature that i am
for the sake of a little pleasant food i have deprived myself of my life
