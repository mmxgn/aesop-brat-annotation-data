a thief hired a room in a tavern and stayed a while in the hope of stealing something which should enable him to pay his reckoning
when he had waited some days in vain he saw the innkeeper dressed in a new and handsome coat and sitting before his door
the thief sat down beside him and talked with him
as the conversation began to flag the thief yawned terribly and at the same time howled like a wolf
the innkeeper said
why do you howl so fearfully
'
i will tell you
said the thief
but first let me ask you to hold my clothes or i shall tear them to pieces
i know not sir when i got this habit of yawning nor whether these attacks of howling were inflicted on me as a judgment for my crimes or for any other cause
but this i do know that when i yawn for the third time i actually turn into a wolf and attack men
with this speech he commenced a second fit of yawning and again howled like a wolf as he had at first
the innkeeper
hearing his tale and believing what he said became greatly alarmed and rising from his seat attempted to run away
the thief laid hold of his coat and entreated him to stop saying
pray wait sir and hold my clothes or i shall tear them to pieces in my fury when i turn into a wolf
at the same moment he yawned the third time and set up a terrible howl
the innkeeper frightened lest he should be attacked left his new coat in the thief 's hand and ran as fast as he could into the inn for safety
the thief made off with the coat and did not return again to the inn
