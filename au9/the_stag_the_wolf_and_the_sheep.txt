a stag asked a sheep to lend him a measure of wheat and said that the wolf would be his surety
the sheep fearing some fraud was intended excused herself saying
the wolf is accustomed to seize what he wants and to run off
and you too can quickly outstrip me in your rapid flight
how then shall i be able to find you when the day of payment comes
