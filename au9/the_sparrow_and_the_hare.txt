a hare pounced upon by an eagle sobbed very much and uttered cries like a child
a sparrow upbraided her and said
where now is thy remarkable swiftness of foot
why were your feet so slow
while the sparrow was thus speaking a hawk suddenly seized him and killed him
the hare was comforted in her death and expiring said
ah
you who so lately when you supposed yourself safe exulted over my calamity have now reason to deplore a similar misfortune
