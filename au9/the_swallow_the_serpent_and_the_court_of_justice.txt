a swallow returning from abroad and especially fond of dwelling with men built herself a nest in the wall of a court of justice and there hatched seven young birds
a serpent gliding past the nest from its hole in the wall ate up the young unfledged nestlings
the swallow finding her nest empty lamented greatly and exclaimed
woe to me a stranger
that in this place where all others ' rights are protected i alone should suffer wrong
