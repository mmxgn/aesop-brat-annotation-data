two travelers worn out by the heat of the summer 's sun laid themselves down at noon under the widespreading branches of a plane-tree
as they rested under its shade one of the travelers said to the other
what a singularly useless tree is the plane
it bears no fruit and is not of the least service to man
the plane-tree interrupting him said
you ungrateful fellows
do you while receiving benefits from me and resting under my shade dare to describe me as useless and unprofitable
