a stag roundly chased by the hounds and blinded by fear to the danger he was running into took shelter in a farmyard and hid himself in a shed among the oxen
an ox gave him this kindly warning
o unhappy creature
why should you thus of your own accord incur destruction and trust yourself in the house of your enemy
' the stag replied
only allow me friend to stay where i am and i will undertake to find some favorable opportunity of effecting my escape
at the approach of the evening the herdsman came to feed his cattle but did not see the stag
and even the farm-bailiff with several laborers passed through the shed and failed to notice him
the stag congratulating himself on his safety began to express his sincere thanks to the oxen who had kindly helped him in the hour of need
one of them again answered him
we indeed wish you well but the danger is not over
there is one other yet to pass through the shed who has as it were a hundred eyes and until he has come and gone your life is still in peril
at that moment the master himself entered and having had to complain that his oxen had not been properly fed he went up to their racks and cried out
why is there such a scarcity of fodder
there is not half enough straw for them to lie on
those lazy fellows have not even swept the cobwebs away
while he thus examined everything in turn he spied the tips of the antlers of the stag peeping out of the straw
then summoning his laborers he ordered that the stag should be seized and killed
