a lion had come to the end of his days and lay sick unto death at the mouth of his cave gasping for breath
the animals his subjects came round him and drew nearer as he grew more and more helpless
when they saw him on the point of death they thought to themselves
now is the time to pay off old grudges
so the boar came up and drove at him with his tusks
then a bull gored him with his horns
still the lion lay helpless before them so the ass feeling quite safe from danger came up and turning his tail to the lion kicked up his heels into his face
this is a double death
growled the lion
