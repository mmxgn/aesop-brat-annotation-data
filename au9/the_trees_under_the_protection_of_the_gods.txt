the gods according to an ancient legend made choice of certain trees to be under their special protection
jupiter chose the oak venus the myrtle apollo the laurel cybele the pine and hercules the poplar
minerva wondering why they had preferred trees not yielding fruit inquired the reason for their choice
jupiter replied
it is lest we should seem to covet the honor for the fruit
but said minerva
let anyone say what he will the olive is more dear to me on account of its fruit
then said jupiter
my daughter you are rightly called wise
for unless what we do is useful the glory of it is vain
