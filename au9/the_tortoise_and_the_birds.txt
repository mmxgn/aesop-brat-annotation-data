a tortoise desired to change its place of residence so he asked an eagle to carry him to his new home promising her a rich reward for her trouble
the eagle agreed and seizing the tortoise by the shell with her talons soared aloft
on their way they met a crow who said to the eagle
tortoise is good eating
the shell is too hard
said the eagle in reply
the rocks will soon crack the shell
was the crow 's answer
and the eagle taking the hint let fall the tortoise on a sharp rock and the two birds made a hearty meal of the tortoise
