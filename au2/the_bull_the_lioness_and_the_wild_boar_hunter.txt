a bull finding a lion 's cub asleep gored him to death with his horns
the lioness came up and bitterly lamented the death of her whelp
a wild-boar hunter seeing her distress stood at a distance and said to her
think how many men there are who have reason to lament the loss of their children whose deaths have been caused by you
