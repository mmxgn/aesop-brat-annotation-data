a birdcatcher was about to sit down to a dinner of herbs when a friend unexpectedly came in
the bird-trap was quite empty as he had caught nothing and he had to kill a pied partridge which he had tamed for a decoy
the bird entreated earnestly for his life
what would you do without me when next you spread your nets
who would chirp you to sleep or call for you the covey of answering birds
' the birdcatcher spared his life and determined to pick out a fine young cock just attaining to his comb
but the cock expostulated in piteous tones from his perch
if you kill me who will announce to you the appearance of the dawn
who will wake you to your daily tasks or tell you when it is time to visit the bird-trap in the morning
' he replied
what you say is true
you are a capital bird at telling the time of day
but my friend and i must have our dinners
