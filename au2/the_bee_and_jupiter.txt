a bee from mount hymettus the queen of the hive ascended to olympus to present jupiter some honey fresh from her combs
jupiter delighted with the offering of honey promised to give whatever she should ask
she therefore besought him saying
give me i pray thee a sting that if any mortal shall approach to take my honey i may kill him
jupiter was much displeased for he loved the race of man but could not refuse the request because of his promise
he thus answered the bee
you shall have your request but it will be at the peril of your own life
for if you use your sting it shall remain in the wound you make and then you will die from the loss of it
