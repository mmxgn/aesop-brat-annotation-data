the gods were once disputing whether it was possible for a living being to change its nature
jupiter said
yes
but venus said
no
so to try the question jupiter turned a cat into a maiden and gave her to a young man for a wife
the wedding was duly performed and the young couple sat down to the wedding-feast
see
said jupiter to venus
how becomingly she behaves
who could tell that yesterday she was but a cat
surely her nature is changed
wait a minute
replied venus and let loose a mouse into the room
no sooner did the bride see this than she jumped up from her seat and tried to pounce upon the mouse
ah you see
said venus
nature will out
