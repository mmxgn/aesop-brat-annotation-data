a charger feeling the infirmities of age was sent to work in a mill instead of going out to battle
but when he was compelled to grind instead of serving in the wars he bewailed his change of fortune and called to mind his former state saying
ah
miller i had indeed to go campaigning before but i was barbed from counter to tail and a man went along to groom me
and now i can not understand what ailed me to prefer the mill before the battle
forbear
said the miller to him
harping on what was of yore for it is the common lot of mortals to sustain the ups and downs of fortune
