a bull escaping from a lion hid in a cave which some shepherds had recently occupied
as soon as he entered a he-goat left in the cave sharply attacked him with his horns
the bull quietly addressed him
butt away as much as you will
i have no fear of you but of the lion
let that monster go away and i will soon let you know what is the respective strength of a goat and a bull
distress
