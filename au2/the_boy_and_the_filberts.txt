a boy put his hand into a pitcher full of filberts
he grasped as many as he could possibly hold but when he tried to pull out his hand he was prevented from doing so by the neck of the pitcher
unwilling to lose his filberts and yet unable to withdraw his hand he burst into tears and bitterly lamented his disappointment
a bystander said to him
be satisfied with half the quantity and you will readily draw out your hand
