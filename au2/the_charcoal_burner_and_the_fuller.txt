a charcoal-burner carried on his trade in his own house
one day he met a friend a fuller and entreated him to come and live with him saying that they should be far better neighbors and that their housekeeping expenses would be lessened
the fuller replied
the arrangement is impossible as far as i am concerned for whatever i should whiten you would immediately blacken again with your charcoal
like will draw like
