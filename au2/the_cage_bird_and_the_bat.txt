a singing bird was confined in a cage which hung outside a window and had a way of singing at night when all other birds were asleep
one night a bat came and clung to the bars of the cage and asked the bird why she was silent by day and sang only at night
i have a very good reason for doing so
said the bird
it was once when i was singing in the daytime that a fowler was attracted by my voice and set his nets for me and caught me
since then i have never sung except by night
but the bat replied
it is no use your doing that now when you are a prisoner if only you had done so before you were caught you might still have been free
