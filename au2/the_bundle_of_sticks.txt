an old man on the point of death summoned his sons around him to give them some parting advice
he ordered his servants to bring in a faggot of sticks and said to his eldest son
break it
the son strained and strained but with all his efforts was unable to break the bundle
the other sons also tried but none of them was successful
untie the faggots
said the father
and each of you take a stick
when they had done so he called out to them
now break
and each stick was easily broken
you see my meaning
said their father
