a blind man was accustomed to distinguishing different animals by touching them with his hands
the whelp of a wolf was brought him with a request that he would feel it and say what it was
he felt it and being in doubt said
i do not quite know whether it is the cub of a fox or the whelp of a wolf but this i know full well
it would not be safe to admit him to the sheepfold
