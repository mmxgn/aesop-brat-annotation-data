a great conflict was about to come off between the birds and the beasts
when the two armies were collected together the bat hesitated which to join
the birds that passed his perch said
come with us
but he said
i am a beast
later on some beasts who were passing underneath him looked up and said
come with us
but he said
i am a bird
luckily at the last moment peace was made and no battle took place so the bat came to the birds and wished to join in the rejoicings but they all turned against him and he had to fly away
he then went to the beasts but soon had to beat a retreat or else they would have torn him to pieces
ah
said the bat
