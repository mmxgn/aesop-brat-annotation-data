a cobbler unable to make a living by his trade and made desperate by poverty began to practice medicine in a town in which he was not known
he sold a drug pretending that it was an antidote to all poisons and obtained a great name for himself by long-winded puffs and advertisements
when the cobbler happened to fall sick himself of a serious illness the governor of the town determined to test his skill
for this purpose he called for a cup and while filling it with water pretended to mix poison with the cobbler 's antidote commanding him to drink it on the promise of a reward
the cobbler under the fear of death confessed that he had no knowledge of medicine and was only made famous by the stupid clamors of the crowd
the governor then called a public assembly and addressed the citizens
of what folly have you been guilty
you have not hesitated to entrust your heads to a man whom no one could employ to make even the shoes for their feet
