two men were traveling together when a bear suddenly met them on their path
one of them climbed up quickly into a tree and concealed himself in the branches
the other seeing that he must be attacked fell flat on the ground and when the bear came up and felt him with his snout and smelt him all over he held his breath and feigned the appearance of death as much as he could
the bear soon left him for it is said he will not touch a dead body
when he was quite gone the other traveler descended from the tree and jocularly inquired of his friend what it was the bear had whispered in his ear
he gave me this advice
his companion replied
never travel with a friend who deserts you at the approach of danger
