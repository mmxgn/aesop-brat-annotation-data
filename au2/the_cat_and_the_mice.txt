a certain house was overrun with mice
a cat discovering this made her way into it and began to catch and eat them one by one
fearing for their lives the mice kept themselves close in their holes
the cat was no longer able to get at them and perceived that she must tempt them forth by some device
for this purpose she jumped upon a peg and suspending herself from it pretended to be dead
one of the mice peeping stealthily out saw her and said
ah my good madam even though you should turn into a meal-bag we will not come near you
