one day the countrymen noticed that the mountains were in labour
smoke came out of their summits the earth was quaking at their feet trees were crashing and huge rocks were tumbling
they felt sure that something horrible was going to happen
they all gathered together in one place to see what terrible thing this could be
they waited and they waited but nothing came
at last there was a still more violent earthquake and a huge gap appeared in the side of the mountains
they all fell down upon their knees and waited
