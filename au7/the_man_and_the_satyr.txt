a man had lost his way in a wood one bitter winter 's night
as he was roaming about a satyr came up to him and finding that he had lost his way promised to give him a lodging for the night and guide him out of the forest in the morning
as he went along to the satyr 's cell the man raised both his hands to his mouth and kept on blowing at them
what do you do that for
said the satyr
my hands are numb with the cold
said the man
and my breath warms them
after this they arrived at the satyr 's home and soon the satyr put a smoking dish of porridge before him
but when the man raised his spoon to his mouth he began blowing upon it
and what do you do that for
said the satyr
the porridge is too hot and my breath will cool it
out you go
said the satyr
i will have nought to do with a man who can blow hot and cold with the same breath
