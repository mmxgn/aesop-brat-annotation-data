be quiet now
said an old nurse to a child sitting on her lap
if you make that noise again i will throw you to the wolf
now it chanced that a wolf was passing close under the window as this was said
so he crouched down by the side of the house and waited
i am in good luck to-day
thought he
it is sure to cry soon and a daintier morsel i have n't had for many a long day
so he waited and he waited and he waited till at last the child began to cry and the wolf came forward before the window and looked up to the nurse wagging his tail
but all the nurse did was to shut down the window and call for help and the dogs of the house came rushing out
ah
