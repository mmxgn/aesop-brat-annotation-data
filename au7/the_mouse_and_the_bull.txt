a bull was bitten by a mouse and angered by the wound tried to capture him
but the mouse reached his hole in safety
though the bull dug into the walls with his horns he tired before he could rout out the mouse and crouching down went to sleep outside the hole
the mouse peeped out crept furtively up his flank and again biting him retreated to his hole
the bull rising up and not knowing what to do was sadly perplexed
at which the mouse said
the great do not always prevail
there are times when the small and lowly are the strongest to do mischief
