patty the milkmaid was going to market carrying her milk in a pail on her head
as she went along she began calculating what she would do with the money she would get for the milk
i 'll buy some fowls from farmer brown
said she
and they will lay eggs each morning which i will sell to the parson 's wife
with the money that i get from the sale of these eggs i 'll buy myself a new dimity frock and a chip hat
and when i go to market wo n't all the young men come up and speak to me
polly shaw will be that jealous
but i do n't care
i shall just look at her and toss my head like this
as she spoke she tossed her head back the pail fell off it and all the milk was spilt
so she had to go home and tell her mother what had occurred
ah my child
