an old labourer bent double with age and toil was gathering sticks in a forest
at last he grew so tired and hopeless that he threw down the bundle of sticks and cried out
i can not bear this life any longer
ah i wish death would only come and take me
as he spoke death a grisly skeleton appeared and said to him
what wouldst thou mortal
i heard thee call me
please sir
replied the woodcutter
would you kindly help me to lift this faggot of sticks on to my shoulder
