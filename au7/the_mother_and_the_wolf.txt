a famished wolf was prowling about in the morning in search of food
as he passed the door of a cottage built in the forest he heard a mother say to her child
be quiet or i will throw you out of the window and the wolf shall eat you
the wolf sat all day waiting at the door
in the evening he heard the same woman fondling her child and saying
you are quiet now and if the wolf should come we will kill him
the wolf hearing these words went home gasping with cold and hunger
when he reached his den mistress wolf inquired of him why he returned wearied and supperless so contrary to his wont
he replied
why forsooth
use i gave credence to the words of a woman
