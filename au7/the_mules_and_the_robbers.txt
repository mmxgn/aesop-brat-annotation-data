two mules well-laden with packs were trudging along
one carried panniers filled with money the other sacks weighted with grain
the mule carrying the treasure walked with head erect as if conscious of the value of his burden and tossed up and down the clear-toned bells fastened to his neck
his companion followed with quiet and easy step
all of a sudden robbers rushed upon them from their hiding-places and in the scuffle with their owners wounded with a sword the mule carrying the treasure which they greedily seized while taking no notice of the grain
the mule which had been robbed and wounded bewailed his misfortunes
the other replied
i am indeed glad that i was thought so little of for i have lost nothing nor am i hurt with any wound
