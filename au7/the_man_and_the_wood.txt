a man came into a wood one day with an axe in his hand and begged all the trees to give him a small branch which he wanted for a particular purpose
the trees were good-natured and gave him one of their branches
what did the man do but fix it into the axe head and soon set to work cutting down tree after tree
then the trees saw how foolish they had been in giving their enemy the means of destroying themselves
