a man and his son were once going with their donkey to market
as they were walking along by its side a countryman passed them and said
you fools what is a donkey for but to ride upon
so the man put the boy on the donkey and they went on their way
but soon they passed a group of men one of whom said
see that lazy youngster he lets his father walk while he rides
so the man ordered his boy to get off and got on himself
but they had n't gone far when they passed two women one of whom said to the other
shame on that lazy lout to let his poor little son trudge along
well the man did n't know what to do but at last he took his boy up before him on the donkey
by this time they had come to the town and the passers-by began to jeer and point at them
the man stopped and asked what they were scoffing at
the men said
are n't you ashamed of yourself for overloading that poor donkey with you and your hulking son
the man and boy got off and tried to think what to do
they thought and they thought till at last they cut down a pole tied the donkey 's feet to it and raised the pole and the donkey to their shoulders
they went along amid the laughter of all who met them till they came to market bridge when the donkey getting one of his feet loose kicked out and caused the boy to drop his end of the pole
in the struggle the donkey fell over the bridge and his fore-feet being tied together he was drowned
that will teach you
