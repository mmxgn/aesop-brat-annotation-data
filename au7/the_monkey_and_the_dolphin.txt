a sailor bound on a long voyage took with him a monkey to amuse him while on shipboard
as he sailed off the coast of greece a violent tempest arose in which the ship was wrecked and he his monkey and all the crew were obliged to swim for their lives
a dolphin saw the monkey contending with the waves and supposing him to be a man ( whom he is always said to befriend ) came and placed himself under him to convey him on his back in safety to the shore
when the dolphin arrived with his burden in sight of land not far from athens he asked the monkey if he were an athenian
the latter replied that he was and that he was descended from one of the most noble families in that city
the dolphin then inquired if he knew the piraeus ( the famous harbor of athens )
supposing that a man was meant the monkey answered that he knew him very well and that he was an intimate friend
the dolphin indignant at these falsehoods dipped the monkey under the water and drowned him
