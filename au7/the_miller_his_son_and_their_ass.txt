a miller and his son were driving their ass to a neighboring fair to sell him
they had not gone far when they met with a troop of women collected round a well talking and laughing
look there
cried one of them
did you ever see such fellows to be trudging along the road on foot when they might ride
' the old man hearing this quickly made his son mount the ass and continued to walk along merrily by his side
presently they came up to a group of old men in earnest debate
there
said one of them
it proves what i was a-saying
what respect is shown to old age in these days
do you see that idle lad riding while his old father has to walk
get down you young scapegrace and let the old man rest his weary limbs
upon this the old man made his son dismount and got up himself
in this manner they had not proceeded far when they met a company of women and children
why you lazy old fellow
cried several tongues at once
how can you ride upon the beast while that poor little lad there can hardly keep pace by the side of you
' the good-natured miller immediately took up his son behind him
they had now almost reached the town
pray honest friend
said a citizen
is that ass your own
'
yes
replied the old man
o one would not have thought so
said the other
by the way you load him
why you two fellows are better able to carry the poor beast than he you
anything to please you
said the old man
we can but try
so alighting with his son they tied the legs of the ass together and with the help of a pole endeavored to carry him on their shoulders over a bridge near the entrance to the town
this entertaining sight brought the people in crowds to laugh at it till the ass not liking the noise nor the strange handling that he was subject to broke the cords that bound him and tumbling off the pole fell into the river
upon this the old man vexed and ashamed made the best of his way home again convinced that by endeavoring to please everybody he had pleased nobody and lost his ass in the bargain
