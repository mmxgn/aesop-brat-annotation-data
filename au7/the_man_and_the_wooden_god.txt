in the old days men used to worship stocks and stones and idols and prayed to them to give them luck
it happened that a man had often prayed to a wooden idol he had received from his father but his luck never seemed to change
he prayed and he prayed but still he remained as unlucky as ever
one day in the greatest rage he went to the wooden god and with one blow swept it down from its pedestal
the idol broke in two and what did he see
an immense number of coins flying all over the place
