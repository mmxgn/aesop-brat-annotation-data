an old woman having lost the use of her eyes called in a physician to heal them and made this bargain with him in the presence of witnesses that if he should cure her blindness he should receive from her a sum of money
but if her infirmity remained she should give him nothing
this agreement being made the physician time after time applied his salve to her eyes and on every visit took something away stealing all her property little by little
and when he had got all she had he healed her and demanded the promised payment
the old woman when she recovered her sight and saw none of her goods in her house would give him nothing
the physician insisted on his claim and
as she still refused summoned her before the judge
the old woman standing up in the court argued
this man here speaks the truth in what he says
for i did promise to give him a sum of money if i should recover my sight but if i continued blind i was to give him nothing
now he declares that i am healed
i on the contrary affirm that i am still blind
for when i lost the use of my eyes i saw in my house various chattels and valuable goods but now though he swears i am cured of my blindness i am not able to see a single thing in it
