the old hound a hound who in the days of his youth and strength had never yielded to any beast of the forest encountered in his old age a boar in the chase
he seized him boldly by the ear but could not retain his hold because of the decay of his teeth so that the boar escaped
his master quickly coming up was very much disappointed and fiercely abused the dog
the hound looked up and said
it was not my fault
master my spirit was as good as ever but i could not help my infirmities
i rather deserve to be praised for what i have been than to be blamed for what i am
