a countryman 's son by accident trod upon a serpent 's tail which turned and bit him so that he died
the father in a rage got his axe and pursuing the serpent cut off part of its tail
so the serpent in revenge began stinging several of the farmer 's cattle and caused him severe loss
well the farmer thought it best to make it up with the serpent and brought food and honey to the mouth of its lair and said to it
let 's forget and forgive
perhaps you were right to punish my son and take vengeance on my cattle but surely i was right in trying to revenge him
now that we are both satisfied why should not we be friends again
no no
said the serpent
take away your gifts
you can never forget the death of your son nor i the loss of my tail
