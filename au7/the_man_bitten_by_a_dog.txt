a man who had been bitten by a dog went about in quest of someone who might heal him
a friend meeting him and learning what he wanted said
if you would be cured take a piece of bread and dip it in the blood from your wound and go and give it to the dog that bit you
the man who had been bitten laughed at this advice and said
why
if i should do so it would be as if i should beg every dog in the town to bite me
benefits bestowed upon the evil-disposed increase their means of injuring you
