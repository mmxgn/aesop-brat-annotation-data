the manslayer a man committed a murder and was pursued by the relations of the man whom he murdered
on his reaching the river nile he saw a lion on its bank and being fearfully afraid climbed up a tree
he found a serpent in the upper branches of the tree and again being greatly alarmed he threw himself into the river where a crocodile caught him and ate him
thus the earth the air and the water alike refused shelter to a murderer
