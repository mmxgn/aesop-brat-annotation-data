a farmer 's daughter was carrying her pail of milk from the field to the farmhouse when she fell a-musing
the money for which this milk will be sold will buy at least three hundred eggs
the eggs allowing for all mishaps will produce two hundred and fifty chickens
the chickens will become ready for the market when poultry will fetch the highest price so that by the end of the year i shall have money enough from my share to buy a new gown
in this dress i will go to the christmas parties where all the young fellows will propose to me but i will toss my head and refuse them every one
at this moment she tossed her head in unison with her thoughts when down fell the milk pail to the ground and all her imaginary schemes perished in a moment
