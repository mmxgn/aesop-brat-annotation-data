once upon a time there was a miser who used to hide his gold at the foot of a tree in his garden
but every week he used to go and dig it up and gloat over his gains
a robber who had noticed this went and dug up the gold and decamped with it
when the miser next came to gloat over his treasures he found nothing but the empty hole
he tore his hair and raised such an outcry that all the neighbours came around him and he told them how he used to come and visit his gold
did you ever take any of it out
asked one of them
nay
said he
i only came to look at it
then come again and look at the hole
said a neighbour
it will do you just as much good
