a young man had been caught in a daring act of theft and had been condemned to be executed for it
he expressed his desire to see his mother and to speak with her before he was led to execution and of course this was granted
when his mother came to him he said
i want to whisper to you
and when she brought her ear near him he nearly bit it off
all the bystanders were horrified and asked him what he could mean by such brutal and inhuman conduct
it is to punish her
he said
when i was young i began with stealing little things and brought them home to mother
instead of rebuking and punishing me she laughed and said
it will not be noticed
it is because of her that i am here to-day
he is right woman
said the priest
the lord hath said
train up a child in the way he should go
and when he is old he will not depart therefrom
