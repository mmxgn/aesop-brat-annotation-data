a wild boar stood under a tree and rubbed his tusks against the trunk
a fox passing by asked him why he thus sharpened his teeth when there was no danger threatening from either huntsman or hound
he replied
i do it advisedly
for it would never do to have to sharpen my weapons just at the time i ought to be using them
