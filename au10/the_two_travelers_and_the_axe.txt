two men were journeying together
one of them picked up an axe that lay upon the path and said
i have found an axe
nay my friend
replied the other
do not say 'i ' but 'we ' have found an axe
they had not gone far before they saw the owner of the axe pursuing them and he who had picked up the axe said
we are undone
nay
replied the other
keep to your first mode of speech my friend
what you thought right then think right now
say 'i ' not 'we ' are undone
