a wolf had been gorging on an animal he had killed when suddenly a small bone in the meat stuck in his throat and he could not swallow it
he soon felt terrible pain in his throat and ran up and down groaning and groaning and seeking for something to relieve the pain
he tried to induce every one he met to remove the bone
i would give anything
said he
if you would take it out
at last the crane agreed to try and told the wolf to lie on his side and open his jaws as wide as he could
then the crane put its long neck down the wolf 's throat and with its beak loosened the bone till at last it got it out
will you kindly give me the reward you promised
said the crane
the wolf grinned and showed his teeth and said
be content
you have put your head inside a wolf 's mouth and taken it out again in safety
that ought to be reward enough for you
