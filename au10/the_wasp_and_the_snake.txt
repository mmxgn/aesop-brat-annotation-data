a wasp seated himself upon the head of a snake and striking him unceasingly with his stings wounded him to death
the snake being in great torment and not knowing how to rid himself of his enemy saw a wagon heavily laden with wood and went and purposely placed his head under the wheels saying
at least my enemy and i shall perish together
