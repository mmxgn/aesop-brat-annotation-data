a vine was luxuriant in the time of vintage with leaves and grapes
a goat passing by nibbled its young tendrils and its leaves
the vine addressed him and said
why do you thus injure me without a cause and crop my leaves
is there no young grass left
but i shall not have to wait long for my just revenge
for if you now should crop my leaves and cut me down to my root i shall provide the wine to pour over you when you are led as a victim to the sacrifice
