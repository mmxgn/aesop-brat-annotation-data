a certain poor widow had one solitary sheep
at shearing time wishing to take his fleece and to avoid expense she sheared him herself but used the shears so unskillfully that with the fleece she sheared the flesh
the sheep writhing with pain said
why do you hurt me so mistress
what weight can my blood add to the wool
if you want my flesh there is the butcher who will kill me in an instant
but if you want my fleece and wool there is the shearer who will shear and not hurt me
