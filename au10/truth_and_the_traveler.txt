a wayfaring man traveling in the desert met a woman standing alone and terribly dejected
he inquired of her
who art thou
my name is truth
she replied
and for what cause
he asked
have you left the city to dwell alone here in the wilderness
she made answer
because in former times falsehood was with few but is now with all men
