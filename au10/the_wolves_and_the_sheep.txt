why should there always be this fear and slaughter between us
said the wolves to the sheep
those evil-disposed dogs have much to answer for
they always bark whenever we approach you and attack us before we have done any harm
if you would only dismiss them from your heels there might soon be treaties of peace and reconciliation between us
the sheep poor silly creatures were easily beguiled and dismissed the dogs whereupon the wolves destroyed the unguarded flock at their own pleasure
