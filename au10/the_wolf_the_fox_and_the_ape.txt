a wolf accused a fox of theft but the fox entirely denied the charge
an ape undertook to adjudge the matter between them
when each had fully stated his case the ape announced this sentence
i do not think you wolf ever lost what you claim
and i do believe you fox to have stolen what you so stoutly deny
