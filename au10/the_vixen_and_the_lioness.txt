a vixen who was taking her babies out for an airing one balmy morning came across a lioness with her cub in arms
why such airs haughty dame over one solitary cub
sneered the vixen
look at my healthy and numerous litter here and imagine if you are able how a proud mother should feel
the lioness gave her a squelching look and lifting up her nose walked away saying calmly
yes just look at that beautiful collection
what are they
foxes
i 've only one but remember that one is a lion
quality is better than quantity
