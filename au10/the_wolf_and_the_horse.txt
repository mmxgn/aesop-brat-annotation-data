a wolf coming out of a field of oats met a horse and thus addressed him
i would advise you to go into that field
it is full of fine oats which i have left untouched for you as you are a friend whom i would love to hear enjoying good eating
the horse replied
if oats had been the food of wolves you would never have indulged your ears at the cost of your belly
men of evil reputation when they perform a good deed fail to get credit for it
