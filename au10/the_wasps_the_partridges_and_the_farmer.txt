the wasps and the partridges overcome with thirst came to a farmer and besought him to give them some water to drink
they promised amply to repay him the favor which they asked
the partridges declared that they would dig around his vines and make them produce finer grapes
the wasps said that they would keep guard and drive off thieves with their stings
but the farmer interrupted them saying
i have already two oxen who without making any promises do all these things
it is surely better for me to give the water to them than to you
