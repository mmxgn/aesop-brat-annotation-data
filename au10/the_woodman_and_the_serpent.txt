one wintry day a woodman was tramping home from his work when he saw something black lying on the snow
when he came closer he saw it was a serpent to all appearance dead
but he took it up and put it in his bosom to warm while he hurried home
as soon as he got indoors he put the serpent down on the hearth before the fire
the children watched it and saw it slowly come to life again
then one of them stooped down to stroke it but thc serpent raised its head and put out its fangs and was about to sting the child to death
so the woodman seized his axe and with one stroke cut the serpent in two
ah
