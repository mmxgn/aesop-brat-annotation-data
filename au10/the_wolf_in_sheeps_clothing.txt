once upon a time a wolf resolved to disguise his appearance in order to secure food more easily
encased in the skin of a sheep he pastured with the flock deceiving the shepherd by his costume
in the evening he was shut up by the shepherd in the fold
the gate was closed and the entrance made thoroughly secure
but the shepherd returning to the fold during the night to obtain meat for the next day mistakenly caught up the wolf instead of a sheep and killed him instantly
