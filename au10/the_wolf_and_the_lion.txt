a wolf having stolen a lamb from a fold was carrying him off to his lair
a lion met him in the path and seizing the lamb took it from him
standing at a safe distance the wolf exclaimed
you have unrighteously taken that which was mine from me
to which the lion jeeringly replied
it was righteously yours eh
the gift of a friend
