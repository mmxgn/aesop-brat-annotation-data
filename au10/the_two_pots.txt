two pots had been left on the bank of a river one of brass and one of earthenware
when the tide rose they both floated off down the stream
now the earthenware pot tried its best to keep aloof from the brass one which cried out
fear nothing friend i will not strike you
but i may come in contact with you
said the other
if i come too close
and whether i hit you or you hit me i shall suffer for it
