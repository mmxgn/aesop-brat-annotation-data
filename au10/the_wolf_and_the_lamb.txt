once upon a time a wolf was lapping at a spring on a hillside when looking up what should he see but a lamb just beginning to drink a little lower down
there 's my supper
thought he
if only i can find some excuse to seize it
then he called out to the lamb
how dare you muddle the water from which i am drinking
nay master nay
said lambikin
if the water be muddy up there i can not be the cause of it for it runs down from you to me
well then
said the wolf
why did you call me bad names this time last year
that can not be
said the lamb
i am only six months old
i do n't care
snarled the wolf
if it was not you it was your father
and with that he rushed upon the poor little lamb and .warra warra warra warra warra .ate her all up
