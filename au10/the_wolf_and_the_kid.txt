a kid was perched up on the top of a house and looking down saw a wolf passing under him
immediately he began to revile and attack his enemy
murderer and thief
he cried
what do you here near honest folks ' houses
how dare you make an appearance where your vile deeds are known
curse away my young friend
said the wolf
