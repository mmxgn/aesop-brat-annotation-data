a scorpion befriended a ladybug who became a loyal companion to him
a time came when she struggled to cross a challenging and dangerous river and so the scorpion offered to take her to the other side on his back
he had come to care for her and promised he would never harm her
but safely across the river he allowed his tail to dip upon her with its venomous sting
as she lay in greatest pain she said
but you promised
why
he shrugged and said sadly
because it is my nature
regardless of our wishes or even our intent it is to our nature alone that we will be faithful
