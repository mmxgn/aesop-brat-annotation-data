a shepherd driving his sheep to a wood saw an oak of unusual size full of acorns and spreading his cloak under the branches he climbed up into the tree and shook them down
the sheep eating the acorns inadvertently frayed and tore the cloak
when the shepherd came down and saw what was done he said
o you most ungrateful creatures
you provide wool to make garments for all other men but you destroy the clothes of him who feeds you
