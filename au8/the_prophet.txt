the prophet a wizard sitting in the marketplace was telling the fortunes of the passers-by when a person ran up in great haste and announced to him that the doors of his house had been broken open and that all his goods were being stolen
he sighed heavily and hastened away as fast as he could run
a neighbor saw him running and said
oh
you fellow there
you say you can foretell the fortunes of others
how is it you did not foresee your own
