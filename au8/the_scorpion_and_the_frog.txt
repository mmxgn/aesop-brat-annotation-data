a scorpion and a frog meet on the bank of a stream and the scorpion asks the frog to carry him across on its back
the frog asks
how do i know you wo n't sting me
the scorpion says
because if i do i will die too
the frog is satisfied and they set out but in midstream the scorpion stings the frog
the frog feels the onset of paralysis and starts to sink knowing they both will drown but has just enough time to gasp
why
replies the scorpion
its my nature
