an ox drinking at a pool trod on a brood of young frogs and crushed one of them to death
the mother coming up and missing one of her sons inquired of his brothers what had become of him
he is dead dear mother
for just now a very huge beast with four great feet came to the pool and crushed him to death with his cloven heel
the frog puffing herself out inquired
if the beast was as big as that in size
cease mother to puff yourself out
said her son
and do not be angry
for you would i assure you sooner burst than successfully imitate the hugeness of that monster
