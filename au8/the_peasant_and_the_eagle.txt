a peasant found an eagle captured in a trap and much admiring the bird set him free
the eagle did not prove ungrateful to his deliverer for seeing the peasant sitting under a wall which was not safe he flew toward him and with his talons snatched a bundle from his head
when the peasant rose in pursuit the eagle let the bundle fall again
taking it up the man returned to the same place to find that the wall under which he had been sitting had fallen to pieces
and he marveled at the service rendered him by the eagle
