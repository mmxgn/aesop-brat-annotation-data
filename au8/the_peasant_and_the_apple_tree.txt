a peasant had in his garden an apple-tree which bore no fruit but only served as a harbor for the sparrows and grasshoppers
he resolved to cut it down and taking his axe in his hand made a bold stroke at its roots
the grasshoppers and sparrows entreated him not to cut down the tree that sheltered them but to spare it and they would sing to him and lighten his labors
he paid no attention to their request but gave the tree a second and a third blow with his axe
when he reached the hollow of the tree he found a hive full of honey
having tasted the honeycomb he threw down his axe and looking on the tree as sacred took great care of it
