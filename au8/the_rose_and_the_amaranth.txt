a rose and an amaranth blossomed side by side in a garden and the amaranth said to her neighbor
how i envy you your beauty and your sweet scent
no wonder you are such a universal favorite
but the rose replied with a shade of sadness in her voice
ah my dear friend i bloom but for a time my petals soon wither and fall and then i die
but your flowers never fade even if they are cut
for they are everlasting
