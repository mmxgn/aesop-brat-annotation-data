a fowler caught a partridge and was about to kill it
the partridge earnestly begged him to spare his life saying
pray master permit me to live and i will entice many partridges to you in recompense for your mercy to me
the fowler replied
i shall now with less scruple take your life because you are willing to save it at the cost of betraying your friends and relations
