a peacock spreading its gorgeous tail mocked a crane that passed by ridiculing the ashen hue of its plumage and saying
i am robed like a king in gold and purple and all the colors of the rainbow
while you have not a bit of color on your wings
true
replied the crane
but i soar to the heights of heaven and lift up my voice to the stars while you walk below like a cock among the birds of the dunghill
