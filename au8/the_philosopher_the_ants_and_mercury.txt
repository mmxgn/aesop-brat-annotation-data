a philosopher witnessed from the shore the shipwreck of a vessel of which the crew and passengers were all drowned
he inveighed against the injustice of providence which would for the sake of one criminal perchance sailing in the ship allow so many innocent persons to perish
as he was indulging in these reflections he found himself surrounded by a whole army of ants near whose nest he was standing
one of them climbed up and stung him and he immediately trampled them all to death with his foot
mercury presented himself and striking the philosopher with his wand said
and are you indeed to make yourself a judge of the dealings of providence who hast thyself in a similar manner treated these poor ants
