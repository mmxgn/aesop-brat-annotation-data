a doe had had the misfortune to lose one of her eyes and could not see any one approaching her on that side
so to avoid any danger she always used to feed on a high cliff near the sea with her sound eye looking towards the land
by this means she could see whenever the hunters approached her on land and often escaped by this means
but the hunters found out that she was blind of one eye and hiring a boat rowed under the cliff where she used to feed and shot her from the sea
ah
