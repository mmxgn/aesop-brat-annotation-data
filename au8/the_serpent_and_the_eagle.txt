an eagle swooped down upon a serpent and seized it in his talons with the intention of carrying it off and devouring it
but the serpent was too quick for him and had its coils round him in a moment
and then there ensued a life-and-death struggle between the two
a countryman who was a witness of the encounter came to the assistance of the eagle and succeeded in freeing him from the serpent and enabling him to escape
in revenge the serpent spat some of his poison into the man 's drinking-horn
heated with his exertions the man was about to slake his thirst with a draught from the horn when the eagle knocked it out of his hand and spilled its contents upon the ground
