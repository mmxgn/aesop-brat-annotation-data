a young pig was shut up in a fold-yard with a goat and a sheep
on one occasion when the shepherd laid hold of him he grunted and squeaked and resisted violently
the sheep and the goat complained of his distressing cries saying
he often handles us and we do not cry out
to this the pig replied
your handling and mine are very different things
he catches you only for your wool or your milk but he lays hold on me for my very life
