a gnat came and said to a lion
i do not in the least fear you nor are you stronger than i am
for in what does your strength consist
you can scratch with your claws and bite with your teeth an a woman in her quarrels
i repeat that i am altogether more powerful than you
and if you doubt it let us fight and see who will conquer
the gnat having sounded his horn fastened himself upon the lion and stung him on the nostrils and the parts of the face devoid of hair
while trying to crush him the lion tore himself with his claws until he punished himself severely
the gnat thus prevailed over the lion and buzzing about in a song of triumph flew away
but shortly afterwards he became entangled in the meshes of a cobweb and was eaten by a spider
he greatly lamented his fate saying
woe is me
that i who can wage war successfully with the hugest beasts should perish myself from this spider the most inconsiderable of insects
