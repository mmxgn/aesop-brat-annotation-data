the hares were so persecuted by the other beasts they did not know where to go
as soon as they saw a single animal approach them off they used to run
one day they saw a troop of wild horses stampeding about and in quite a panic all the hares scuttled off to a lake hard by determined to drown themselves rather than live in such a continual state of fear
but just as they got near the bank of the lake a troop of frogs frightened in their turn by the approach of the hares scuttled off and jumped into the water
truly
said one of the hares
