at one time the horse had the plain entirely to himself
then a stag intruded into his domain and shared his pasture
the horse desiring to revenge himself on the stranger asked a man if he were willing to help him in punishing the stag
the man replied that if the horse would receive a bit in his mouth and agree to carry him he would contrive effective weapons against the stag
the horse consented and allowed the man to mount him
from that hour he found that instead of obtaining revenge on the stag he had enslaved himself to the service of man
