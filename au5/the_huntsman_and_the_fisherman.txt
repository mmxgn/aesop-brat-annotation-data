a huntsman returning with his dogs from the field fell in by chance with a fisherman who was bringing home a basket well laden with fish
the huntsman wished to have the fish and their owner experienced an equal longing for the contents of the game-bag
they quickly agreed to exchange the produce of their day 's sport
each was so well pleased with his bargain that they made for some time the same exchange day after day
finally a neighbor said to them
if you go on in this way you will soon destroy by frequent use the pleasure of your exchange and each will again wish to retain the fruits of his own sport
abstain and enjoy
