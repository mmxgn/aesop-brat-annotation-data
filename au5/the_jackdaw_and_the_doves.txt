a jackdaw seeing some doves in a cote abundantly provided with food painted himself white and joined them in order to share their plentiful maintenance
the doves as long as he was silent supposed him to be one of themselves and admitted him to their cote
but when one day he forgot himself and began to chatter they discovered his true character and drove him forth pecking him with their beaks
failing to obtain food among the doves he returned to the jackdaws
they too not recognizing him on account of his color
expelled him from living with them
so desiring two ends he obtained neither
