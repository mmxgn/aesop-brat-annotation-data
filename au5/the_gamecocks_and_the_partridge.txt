a man had two gamecocks in his poultry-yard
one day by chance he found a tame partridge for sale
he purchased it and brought it home to be reared with his gamecocks
when the partridge was put into the poultry-yard they struck at it and followed it about so that the partridge became grievously troubled and supposed that he was thus evilly treated because he was a stranger
not long afterwards he saw the cocks fighting together and not separating before one had well beaten the other
he then said to himself
i shall no longer distress myself at being struck at by these gamecocks when i see that they can not even refrain from quarreling with each other
