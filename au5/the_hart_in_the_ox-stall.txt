a hart hotly pursued by the hounds fled for refuge into an ox-stall and buried itself in a truss of hay leaving nothing to be seen but the tips of his horns
soon after the hunters came up and asked if any one had seen the hart
the stable boys who had been resting after their dinner looked round but could see nothing and the hunters went away
shortly afterwards the master came in and looking round saw that something unusual had taken place
he pointed to the truss of hay and said
what are those two curious things sticking out of the hay
and when the stable boys came to look they discovered the hart and soon made an end of him
