a quarrel had arisen between the horse and the stag so the horse came to a hunter to ask his help to take revenge on the stag
the hunter agreed but said
if you desire to conquer the stag you must permit me to place this piece of iron between your jaws so that i may guide you with these reins and allow this saddle to be placed upon your back so that i may keep steady upon you as we follow after the enemy
the horse agreed to the conditions and the hunter soon saddled and bridled him
then with the aid of the hunter the horse soon overcame the stag and said to the hunter
now get off and remove those things from my mouth and back
not so fast friend
said the hunter
i have now got you under bit and spur and prefer to keep you as you are at present
if you allow men to use you for your own purposes they will use you for theirs
