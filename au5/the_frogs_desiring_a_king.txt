the frogs were living as happy as could be in a marshy swamp that just suited them
they went splashing about caring for nobody and nobody troubling with them
but some of them thought that this was not right that they should have a king and a proper constitution so they determined to send up a petition to jove to give them what they wanted
mighty jove
they cried
send unto us a king that will rule over us and keep us in order
jove laughed at their croaking and threw down into the swamp a huge log which came downrplashto the swamp
the frogs were frightened out of their lives by the commotion made in their midst and all rushed to the bank to look at the horrible monster
but after a time seeing that it did not move one or two of the boldest of them ventured out towards the log and even dared to touch it
still it did not move
then the greatest hero of the frogs jumped upon the log and commenced dancing up and down upon it thereupon all the frogs came and did the same
and for some time the frogs went about their business every day without taking the slightest notice of their new king log lying in their midst
but this did not suit them so they sent another petition to jove and said to him
we want a real king
one that will really rule over us
now this made jove angry so he sent among them a big stork that soon set to work gobbling them all up
then the frogs repented when too late
