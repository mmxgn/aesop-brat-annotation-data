a gnat settled on the horn of a bull and sat there a long time
just as he was about to fly off he made a buzzing noise and inquired of the bull if he would like him to go
the bull replied
i did not know you had come and i shall not miss you when you go away
some men are of more consequence in their own eyes than in the eyes of their neighbors
