a man once kept a goat and an ass
the goat envying the ass on account of his greater abundance of food said
how shamefully you are treated at one time grinding in the mill and at another carrying heavy burdens
and he further advised him to pretend to be epileptic and fall into a ditch and so obtain rest
the ass listened to his words and falling into a ditch was very much bruised
his master sending for a leech asked his advice
he bade him pour upon the wounds the lungs of a goat
they at once killed the goat and so healed the ass
