a hunter not very bold was searching for the tracks of a lion
he asked a man felling oaks in the forest if he had seen any marks of his footsteps or knew where his lair was
i will
said the man
at once show you the lion himself
the hunter turning very pale and chattering with his teeth from fear replied
no thank you
i did not ask that
it is his track only i am in search of not the lion himself
