one day a countryman going to the nest of his goose found there an egg all yellow and glittering
when he took it up it was as heavy as lead and he was going to throw it away because he thought a trick had been played upon him
but he took it home on second thoughts and soon found to his delight that it was an egg of pure gold
every morning the same thing occurred and he soon became rich by selling his eggs
as he grew rich he grew greedy
and thinking to get at once all the gold the goose could give he killed it and opened it only to find nothing
