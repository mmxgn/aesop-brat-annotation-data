a goatherd had sought to bring back a stray goat to his flock
he whistled and sounded his horn in vain
the straggler paid no attention to the summons
at last the goatherd threw a stone and breaking its horn begged the goat not to tell his master
the goat replied
why you silly fellow the horn will speak though i be silent
