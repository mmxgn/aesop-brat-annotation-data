the hare was once boasting of his speed before the other animals
i have never yet been beaten
said he
when i put forth my full speed
i challenge any one here to race with me
the tortoise said quietly
i accept your challenge
that is a good joke
said the hare
i could dance round you all the way
keep your boasting till you 've beaten
answered the tortoise
shall we race
so a course was fixed and a start was made
the hare darted almost out of sight at once but soon stopped and to show his contempt for the tortoise lay down to have a nap
the tortoise plodded on and plodded on and when the hare awoke from his nap he saw the tortoise just near the winning-post and could not run up in time to save the race
