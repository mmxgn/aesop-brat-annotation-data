a certain hunter having snared a hare placed it upon his shoulders and set out homewards
on his way he met a man on horseback who begged the hare of him under the pretense of purchasing it
however when the horseman got the hare he rode off as fast as he could
the hunter ran after him as if he was sure of overtaking him but the horseman increased more and more the distance between them
the hunter sorely against his will called out to him and said
get along with you
for i will now make you a present of the hare
