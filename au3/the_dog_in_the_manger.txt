a dog looking out for its afternoon nap jumped into the manger of an ox and lay there cosily upon the straw
but soon the ox returning from its afternoon work came up to the manger and wanted to eat some of the straw
the dog in a rage being awakened from its slumber stood up and barked at the ox and whenever it came near attempted to bite it
at last the ox had to give up the hope of getting at the straw and went away muttering
ah people often grudge others what they can not enjoy themselves
