an ant going to a river to drink fell in and was carried along in the stream
a dove pitied her condition and threw into the river a small bough by means of which the ant gained the shore
the ant afterward seeing a man with a fowling-piece aiming at the dove stung him in the foot sharply and made him miss his aim and so saved the dove 's life
