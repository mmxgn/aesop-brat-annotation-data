an eagle was soaring through the air when suddenly it heard the whizz of an arrow and felt itself wounded to death
slowly it fluttered down to the earth with its life-blood pouring out of it
looking down upon the arrow with which it had been pierced it found that the shaft of the arrow had been feathered with one of its own plumes
alas
