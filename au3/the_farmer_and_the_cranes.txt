some cranes made their feeding grounds on some plowlands newly sown with wheat
for a long time the farmer brandishing an empty sling chased them away by the terror he inspired
but when the birds found that the sling was only swung in the air they ceased to take any notice of it and would not move
the farmer on seeing this charged his sling with stones and killed a great number
the remaining birds at once forsook his fields crying to each other
it is time for us to be off to liliput for this man is no longer content to scare us but begins to show us in earnest what he can do
