a crow caught in a snare prayed to apollo to release him making a vow to offer some frankincense at his shrine
but when rescued from his danger he forgot his promise
shortly afterwards again caught in a snare he passed by apollo and made the same promise to offer frankincense to mercury
mercury soon appeared and said to him
o thou most base fellow
how can i believe thee who hast disowned and wronged thy former patron
