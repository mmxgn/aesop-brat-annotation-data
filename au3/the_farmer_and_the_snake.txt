one winter a farmer found a snake stiff and frozen with cold
he had compassion on it and taking it up placed it in his bosom
the snake was quickly revived by the warmth and resuming its natural instincts bit its benefactor inflicting on him a mortal wound
oh
cried the farmer with his last breath
i am rightly served for pitying a scoundrel
