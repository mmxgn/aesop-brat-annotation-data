a crow was jealous of the raven because he was considered a bird of good omen and always attracted the attention of men who noted by his flight the good or evil course of future events
seeing some travelers approaching the crow flew up into a tree and perching herself on one of the branches cawed as loudly as she could
the travelers turned towards the sound and wondered what it foreboded when one of them said to his companion
let us proceed on our journey my friend for it is only the caw of a crow and her cry you know is no omen
those who assume a character which does not belong to them only make themselves ridiculous
