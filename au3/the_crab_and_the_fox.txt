a crab forsaking the seashore chose a neighboring green meadow as its feeding ground
a fox came across him and being very hungry ate him up
just as he was on the point of being eaten the crab said
i well deserve my fate for what business had i on the land when by my nature and habits i am only adapted for the sea
