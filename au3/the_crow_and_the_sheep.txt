a troublesome crow seated herself on the back of a sheep
the sheep much against his will carried her backward and forward for a long time and at last said
if you had treated a dog in this way you would have had your deserts from his sharp teeth
to this the crow replied
i despise the weak and yield to the strong
i know whom i may bully and whom i must flatter
and i thus prolong my life to a good old age
