a cock was once strutting up and down the farmyard among the hens when suddenly he espied something shinning amid the straw
ho
ho
quoth he
that 's for me
and soon rooted it out from beneath the straw
what did it turn out to be but a pearl that by some chance had been lost in the yard
you may be a treasure
quoth master cock
to men that prize you but for me i would rather have a single barley-corn than a peck of pearls
