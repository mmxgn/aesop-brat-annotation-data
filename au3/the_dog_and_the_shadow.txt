it happened that a dog had got a piece of meat and was carrying it home in his mouth to eat it in peace
now on his way home he had to cross a plank lying across a running brook
as he crossed he looked down and saw his own shadow reflected in the water beneath
thinking it was another dog with another piece of meat he made up his mind to have that also
so he made a snap at the shadow in the water but as he opened his mouth the piece of meat fell out dropped into the water and was never seen more
