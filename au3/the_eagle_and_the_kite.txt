an eagle overwhelmed with sorrow sat upon the branches of a tree in company with a kite
why
said the kite
do i see you with such a rueful look
'
i seek
she replied
a mate suitable for me and am not able to find one
take me
returned the kite
i am much stronger than you are
why are you able to secure the means of living by your plunder
'
well i have often caught and carried away an ostrich in my talons
the eagle persuaded by these words accepted him as her mate
shortly after the nuptials the eagle said
fly off and bring me back the ostrich you promised me
the kite soaring aloft into the air brought back the shabbiest possible mouse stinking from the length of time it had lain about the fields
is this
said the eagle
the faithful fulfillment of your promise to me
' the kite replied
that i might attain your royal hand there is nothing that i would not have promised however much i knew that i must fail in the performance
