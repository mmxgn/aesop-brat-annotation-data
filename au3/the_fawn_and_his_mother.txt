a young fawn once said to his mother
you are larger than a dog and swifter and more used to running and you have your horns as a defense
why then o mother
do the hounds frighten you so
she smiled and said
i know full well my son that all you say is true
i have the advantages you mention but when i hear even the bark of a single dog i feel ready to faint and fly away as fast as i can
