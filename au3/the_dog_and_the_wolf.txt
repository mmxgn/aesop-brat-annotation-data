a gaunt wolf was almost dead with hunger when he happened to meet a house-dog who was passing by
ah cousin
said the dog
i knew how it would be
your irregular life will soon be the ruin of you
why do you not work steadily as i do and get your food regularly given to you
i would have no objection
said the wolf
if i could only get a place
i will easily arrange that for you
said the dog
come with me to my master and you shall share my work
so the wolf and the dog went towards the town together
on the way there the wolf noticed that the hair on a certain part of the dog 's neck was very much worn away so he asked him how that had come about
oh it is nothing
said the dog
that is only the place where the collar is put on at night to keep me chained up
it chafes a bit but one soon gets used to it
is that all
said the wolf
then good-bye to you master dog
