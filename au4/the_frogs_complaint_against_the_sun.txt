once upon a time when the sun announced his intention to take a wife the frogs lifted up their voices in clamor to the sky
jupiter disturbed by the noise of their croaking inquired the cause of their complaint
one of them said
the sun now while he is single parches up the marsh and compels us to die miserably in our arid homes
what will be our future condition if he should beget other suns
