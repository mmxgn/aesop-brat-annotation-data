one moonlight night a fox was prowling about a farmer 's hen-coop and saw a cock roosting high up beyond his reach
good news good news
he cried
why what is that
said the cock
king lion has declared a universal truce
no beast may hurt a bird henceforth but all shall dwell together in brotherly friendship
why that is good news
said the cock
and there i see some one coming with whom we can share the good tidings
and so saying he craned his neck forward and looked afar off
what is it you see
said the fox
it is only my master 's dog that is coming towards us
what going so soon
he continued as the fox began to turn away as soon as he had heard the news
will you not stop and congratulate the dog on the reign of universal peace
i would gladly do so
said the fox
but i fear he may not have heard of king lion 's decree
