a fowler taking his bird-lime and his twigs went out to catch birds
seeing a thrush sitting upon a tree he wished to take it and fitting his twigs to a proper length watched intently having his whole thoughts directed towards the sky
while thus looking upwards he unknowingly trod upon a viper asleep just before his feet
the viper turning about stung him and falling into a swoon the man said to himself
woe is me
that while i purposed to hunt another i am myself fallen unawares into the snares of death
