a fox once saw a crow fly off with a piece of cheese in its beak and settle on a branch of a tree
that 's for me as i am a fox
said master reynard and he walked up to the foot of the tree
good-day mistress crow
he cried
how well you are looking to-day how glossy your feathers
how bright your eye
i feel sure your voice must surpass that of other birds just as your figure does
let me hear but one song from you that i may greet you as the queen of birds
the crow lifted up her head and began to caw her best but the moment she opened her mouth the piece of cheese fell to the ground only to be snapped up by master fox
that will do
said he
that was all i wanted
