a fly sat on the axle-tree of a chariot and addressing the draught-mule said
how slow you are
why do you not go faster
see if i do not prick your neck with my sting
the draught-mule replied
i do not heed your threats
i only care for him who sits above you and who quickens my pace with his whip or holds me back with the reins
away therefore with your insolence for i know well when to go fast and when to go slow
