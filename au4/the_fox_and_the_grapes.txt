one hot summer 's day a fox was strolling through an orchard till he came to a bunch of grapes just ripening on a vine which had been trained over a lofty branch
just the thing to quench my thirst
quoth he
drawing back a few paces he took a run and a jump and just missed the bunch
turning round again with a one two three he jumped up but with no greater success
again and again he tried after the tempting morsel but at last had to give it up and walked away with his nose in the air saying
i am sure they are sour
