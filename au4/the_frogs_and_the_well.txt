two frogs lived together in a marsh
but one hot summer the marsh dried up and they left it to look for another place to live in for frogs like damp places if they can get them
by and by they came to a deep well and one of them looked down into it and said to the other
this looks a nice cool place
let us jump in and settle here
but the other who had a wiser head on his shoulders replied
not so fast my friend
supposing this well dried up like the marsh how should we get out again
