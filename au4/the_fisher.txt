a fisher once took his bagpipes to the bank of a river and played upon them with the hope of making the fish rise
but never a one put his nose out of the water
so he cast his net into the river and soon drew it forth filled with fish
then he took his bagpipes again and as he played the fish leapt up in the net
ah you dance now when i play
said he
yes
