by an unlucky chance a fox fell into a deep well from which he could not get out
a goat passed by shortly afterwards and asked the fox what he was doing down there
oh have you not heard
said the fox
there is going to be a great drought so i jumped down here in order to be sure to have water by me
why do n't you come down too
the goat thought well of this advice and jumped down into the well
but the fox immediately jumped on her back and by putting his foot on her long horns managed to jump up to the edge of the well
good-bye friend
said the fox
