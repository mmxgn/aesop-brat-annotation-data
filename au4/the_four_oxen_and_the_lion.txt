a lion used to prowl about a field in which four oxen used to dwell
many a time he tried to attack them
but whenever he came near they turned their tails to one another so that whichever way he approached them he was met by the horns of one of them
at last however they fell a-quarrelling among themselves and each went off to pasture alone in a separate corner of the field
then the lion attacked them one by one and soon made an end of all four
