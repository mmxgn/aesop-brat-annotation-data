a fox was boasting to a cat of its clever devices for escaping its enemies
i have a whole bag of tricks
he said
which contains a hundred ways of escaping my enemies
i have only one
said the cat
but i can generally manage with that
just at that moment they heard the cry of a pack of hounds coming towards them and the cat immediately scampered up a tree and hid herself in the boughs
this is my plan
said the cat
what are you going to do
the fox thought first of one way then of another and while he was debating the hounds came nearer and nearer and at last the fox in his confusion was caught up by the hounds and soon killed by the huntsmen
miss puss who had been looking on said
better one safe way than a hundred on which you can not reckon
