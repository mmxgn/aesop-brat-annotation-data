a fox after crossing a river got its tail entangled in a bush and could not move
a number of mosquitoes seeing its plight settled upon it and enjoyed a good meal undisturbed by its tail
a hedgehog strolling by took pity upon the fox and went up to him
you are in a bad way neighbour
said the hedgehog
shall i relieve you by driving off those mosquitoes who are sucking your blood
thank you master hedgehog
said the fox
but i would rather not
why how is that
asked the hedgehog
well you see
was the answer
these mosquitoes have had their fill
if you drive these away others will come with fresh appetite and bleed me to death
