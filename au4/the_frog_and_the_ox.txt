oh father
said a little frog to the big one sitting by the side of a pool
i have seen such a terrible monster
it was as big as a mountain with horns on its head and a long tail and it had hoofs divided in two
tush child tush
said the old frog
that was only farmer white 's ox
it is n't so big either
he may be a little bit taller than i but i could easily make myself quite as broad
just you see
so he blew himself out and blew himself out and blew himself out
was he as big as that
asked he
oh much bigger than that
said the young frog
again the old one blew himself out and asked the young one if the ox was as big as that
bigger father bigger
was the reply
so the frog took a deep breath and blew and blew and blew and swelled and swelled and swelled
and then he said
i 'm sure the ox is not as big as but at this moment he burst
