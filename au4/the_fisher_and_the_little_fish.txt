it happened that a fisher after fishing all day caught only a little fish
pray let me go master
said the fish
i am much too small for your eating just now
if you put me back into the river i shall soon grow then you can make a fine meal off me
nay nay my little fish
said the fisher
i have you now
i may not catch you hereafter
a little thing in hand is worth more than a great thing in prospect
