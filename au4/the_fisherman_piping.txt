a fisherman skilled in music took his flute and his nets to the seashore
standing on a projecting rock he played several tunes in the hope that the fish attracted by his melody would of their own accord dance into his net which he had placed below
at last having long waited in vain he laid aside his flute and casting his net into the sea made an excellent haul of fish
when he saw them leaping about in the net upon the rock he said
o you most perverse creatures when i piped you would not dance but now that i have ceased you do so merrily
