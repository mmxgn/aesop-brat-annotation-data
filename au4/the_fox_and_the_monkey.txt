a fox and a monkey were traveling together on the same road
as they journeyed they passed through a cemetery full of monuments
all these monuments which you see
said the monkey
are erected in honor of my ancestors who were in their day freedmen and citizens of great renown
the fox replied
you have chosen a most appropriate subject for your falsehoods as i am sure none of your ancestors will be able to contradict you
