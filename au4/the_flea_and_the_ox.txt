a flea thus questioned an ox
what ails you that being so huge and strong you submit to the wrongs you receive from men and slave for them day by day while i being so small a creature mercilessly feed on their flesh and drink their blood without stint
' the ox replied
i do not wish to be ungrateful for i am loved and well cared for by men and they often pat my head and shoulders
woe 's me
said the flea
this very patting which you like whenever it happens to me brings with it my inevitable destruction
