two game cocks were fiercely fighting for the mastery of the farmyard
one at last put the other to flight
the vanquished cock skulked away and hid himself in a quiet corner while the conqueror flying up to a high wall flapped his wings and crowed exultingly with all his might
an eagle sailing through the air pounced upon him and carried him off in his talons
the vanquished cock immediately came out of his corner and ruled henceforth with undisputed mastery
