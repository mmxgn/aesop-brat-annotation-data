it happened that a fox caught its tail in a trap and in struggling to release himself lost all of it but the stump
at first he was ashamed to show himself among his fellow foxes
but at last he determined to put a bolder face upon his misfortune and summoned all the foxes to a general meeting to consider a proposal which he had to place before them
when they had assembled together the fox proposed that they should all do away with their tails
he pointed out how inconvenient a tail was when they were pursued by their enemies the dogs
how much it was in the way when they desired to sit down and hold a friendly conversation with one another
he failed to see any advantage in carrying about such a useless encumbrance
that is all very well
said one of the older foxes
but i do not think you would have recommended us to dispense with our chief ornament if you had not happened to lose it yourself
